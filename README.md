# SpellCheckAlgorithm
Java implementation of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm for minimum edit distance. Generates a list of words that are within the target edit distance. 

This implementation compares the word to a complete dictionary. Each comparison determines the edit distance between the strings using the algorithm matrix. 

I included a manual check feature that allows you to view the edit distance for any two strings with the corresponding matrix. Example, comparing boat to bat and boat to bolt:

Some improvements have been made using an XOR operator when comparing letters, which I found reduced some mistakes with repeating letters not being accounted for as a deletion. 
I suggest using a better dictionary txt file as the one I used includes some obscure words. Additionally, through some testing, I realized the dictionary was missing some common words.
